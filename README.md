The Room is a Google Cardboard Work-in-progress game. It has 3 stages, each stage with more tension than the last.

It made in Unity.

## 16th December 2019 Update: HandOff
I've decided to put this project offially on pause. It's honestly almost done (though you know the last 10% always takes 90% of the time ðŸ˜†). 
All the individual levels are playable, all that's needed is transitioning logic and some polish. ~~I've listed most of that in a document in the [Downloads section](https://bitbucket.org/andersonaddo/the-room/downloads/)
of this repo in case anyone feels like finishing this *cough* awesome *cough* game.~~

By the way, here's the order of the levels

- First stage is the cube stage

- Second stage is the corridor stage with the drones

- The third stage is the boss fight with the flaming skeleton.

So I recently migrated the few repos I had on Bitbucket to Github, including this one. Unfortunately, during the migration I lost the handoff documentation, which included all asset source links, known bugs, game plans, etc for the game. I know that probably doesn't matter cuz noone is probably going to continue this game but still..sorry ðŸ˜…

Life happens, I guess.
