# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# This will set all files that haven't been specified below and are text (based off git's heuristics) to LF on checkin
# Provided you have the right git settings (ie core.eol set to native, which is default), 
# they should be converted back to native line endings on checkout

# These files are text and should be normalized (convert crlf to lf)
# Unless otherwise stated, they will be converted back to native upon checkout
