HOLO FX PACK V1.00


Notice :
	A - obviously when you apply the Material to you Geometry , the result will depend on your Geometry's poly number and UVs (you can check the UVs on the Example Geometry

	B - The Geometry Models example is just to showcase the differents Materials (by cvbtruong , source : https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/free-young-boy-head-3d-model/671307)


Feel free to modify the parameters on each example to have a new nice look or behavior.

Tips : 
	Play with the G/H Noise Details Parametere to have more or less noisy Holo/Glitch :).
	In the Advanced version of the Shader , playing with the Cut Level Parametere will give some interesting deintegration effect
	In the Advanced version of the Shader , Play with Origine X/Y Parametere to define the direction of the waves.
